BASH PROGRAMMING:

1) WHILE LOOP:
	a)In a bash while loop, the condition part is always interpretted as a program. 
 
  Normally in a pgm, a return fn will return value to main fn.
  When a return fn is called in main fn, it return value to bash. Such return values are known as exit status.

	eg: 	main()
		{
		return 10;
		}
    
	here the value 10 is known as exit status.

	b)Successfully executed commands have exit status 0
          Failure is indicated by exit status 1.
		(reason for following 0 as success and 1 as f is that
                 unlike sucess,  reason for failure must be indicated.... 
                 so numbers 1,2,3....etc(int values) can be used for this purpose and 0 can simply be considered success)
consider,	
	while ls
	do
  	echo hi
	done

if ls is executed successfully exit status is 0. depending on exit status, the loop executes.
o/p of ls will be displayed among 'hi'.




	c) Redirection to null can be used to avoid the o/p of the condition part. null acts as a data sink which discards all kinds of data.
			eg: ls>dev/null
