-why do we prefer set to list in membership test?
 A: better performance; O(1) look-up
 reason: Set is implemented internally as hash table 



why lists are not implemented as hash table?
Ans:



set membership test takes time O(1)
dictionary lookup takes time O(1)
list/tuple  membership test takes time O(N)


performance depends on :time & memory
