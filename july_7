TCP/IP Networking
----------------

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a communications protocol in a private network.

traceroute : It is a command which can show you the path a packet of information takes from your computer to one you specify. It will list 
all the routers it passes through until it reaches its destination, or fails to and is discarded. In addition to this, it will tell you how 
long each 'hop' from router to router takes.

We can actually see the TCP code  in kernel, it is the part of os kernel.

kernel.org - we can download various versions. "Linux kernel cross refernce" we can see codes by web pages in c code.



client/server


client pgm;

from socket import *  

                                                 library socket: contains high level functions needed for n/w communication
                                                 API-application pgm interface
                                                 berkely socket API
                                                 for our application pgm to interact with the OS kernal networking code 
fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)  
                              
                                                  here socket() is fn available in socket module
                                                  AF_INET and SOCK_DGRAM are two constants defined in socket module
                                                      |          |
                                                      |       tells to use UDP for communiction
                                                      |               if we need tcp to be used we replace sock_dgram by sock_stream

                                             address family --internet protocol ...tells OS kernal that we want to communicate using tcp/ip
                                                  
                                             fd is a kind of object, similar to file descriptor         
fd.sendto('hello',('127.0.0.1', 8000))
             |        |           |
        (message)  (to address)(port number)   




server program:
from socket import *
fd = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_DGRAM)
fd.bind(('127.0.0.1',8000) ----------->tells OS kernal to assign port no 8000 to this program
fd.recvfrom(100)........>function used to receive data. 100 indicates that data is received in blocks of size 100.
                         now pgm is in block/sleeping state and does not consuming any cpu cycles and wakes up when data comes.
