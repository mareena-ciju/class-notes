Sometimes c is mixed with python to increase  performance

-du (disk usage) estimate file space usage


-compilation:
	-gcc (GNU c compiler)/(GNU Compiler Collection)
	-why is c compiler one of the most imp tool in any OS?
           ans: taking a system, almost everything in it is written in c.
                eg: kernal, editors,commands,languages like python, most compilers & interpretors,etc....   is written in c
                c advantages: efficient,fast,low level interactions with h/w etc

                mozilla rust... planned as a c replacement 
	
	cc -v ....version of gcc
	
stages of C ompilation:
1.preprocessing---->macro expansion
2.Comile proper---->assembly code generated
3.Assembly--------->object file created
4Linking----------->executable code generated

stage 2 is most complex phasee in compilation.
GCC: optimizing compiler;re-targetable compiler
