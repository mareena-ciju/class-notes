MEMORY MANAGEMENT IN A C PROGRAM :

-Manual memory management ( explicitly allocate and deallocate memory )
-When a program starts running, It starts with afixed amount of memory allocated to it by the OS.
 Once program starts running, it might need extra memory and uses malloc for the purpose
-memory allocated by malloc is deallocated by free()
-Once a memory is deallocated using free, it should not be further used in the program.
-3 category of data : Local
		      Global
                      malloc

-space for local variables are allocated when a function is called.
 gets deallocated when function ends
-space for global variables are allocated when the pgm starts running
 gets deallocated when pgm ends
-malloc- allocated when we call malloc()
 deallocates when we call free()

realloc- used to change size of allocated block of memory

possible bugs in manual memory management:
-allocate and forget to deallocate
-free more than once
-use after free
-Even if allocated memory has deilta changes made, free can cause pblm.
