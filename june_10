*df-shows information regarding disk
 free-shows information about memory
*swapon-to enable swap
*link of a file-crreates a new directory entry,no data is copied.Inode numbers are same for both files
*link count-count of how many references are pointing to that disk block
*copying a file-new disk blocks are allocated
ln -s a b-symbolic link
	 
*inode-disk data structure holding info about file except name like size,dat e/time,ownership,permissions
*directory-disk data structure contains list of filenames and inode numbers
 disk contains inode table-array of inodes
 inode number-index to the inode table to identify an inode
*When a file is accessed,it looksup in the directory for the filename inode  pair and indexed the inode table and identifies a unique inode
 inode holds the address of the data blocks of the file
 os accesses the blocks and read/write data
*sed-stream editor
*awk-text processing tools
*Variants o f grep:egrep,fgrep
*Daemon-backgrouund process
*Checksum-to verify the integrity of files
*dd-device to device copy command

part1 - test discussion
-----
-to remote login : ssh guest@ipaddress

-to find a file : find / -name filename (attributes like name,date,time ,size, etc can be used individually or combined with find) 

-to find name of the processor which is running on the system and to find how many cores does it have use

this commands less /proc/cpuinfo or lscpu.

-to know kernel version running on this system use uname -a command.

-to know % of disk space used by the root file system , to know name of the device mounted on / and to know

how much swap memory is there on this system use df command.

-to know total amount of RAM available on this system use free or htop commands.

-to find inode number of the file use ls -i command.

disk data layout  (****important*****)
----------------
inode is a 'disk data structure', which holds all information regarding a file except it's name. size of the

file, date/time, ownership, permissions..

a Directory
-----------
a disk data structure.which contains a list of files and inode numbers.

disk: inode table :array of inodes/ sequence of inodes

an inode number is simply an index into this array. it helps you to identify one particular inode.

if we try to access a file (cat a.c)
a)OS first converts (name)a.c ----> (inode number)12678

b)indexes the inode table with this number and idntifies a unique "inode".

c)inode holds:date, time, permissions etc and additionally holds the address of data blocks of the file.(files are split into blocks which may not be continuous)

d)os can access the blocks and read/write data.


link
----

when we copy a file using cp command inode changes, because it create new file.

but using ln(link) command inode does'nt changes, it only create a refernce.

when you create ln you are simply creating a new directory entry. 

no data is copied. no change when moving/rename inode.

ln command can be used in two differnt ways: 
    a) ln a b
    b) ln -s a b (symbolic link)

------------------------

size of file- ls -l

varients of grep :egrep, fgrep, (extended grep,fast grep)

daemon -> program running in background. cron- sheduling program.

pid -> process id

pid 1 -> init

ubuntu version running in the machine: lsb_release -a
network interface :ifconfig (only active interfaces are shown), if config -a --->all interfaces

checksum: varify integrity of files
md5 checksum- md5sum a.txt


dd- device to device copy (parts of a file can be easly copied using this command)
dd if=....  of=..... bs= count= 
   i/p file o/p file block size

/dev/zero= file with endless zero's
