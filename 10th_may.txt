*)don't use GUI, use commands - learn "vim" editor
1)what is Kernel?---core of OS; its the kernel that get loaded when we boot a system.
2)editor commands.........>   uname= get system identification(sys name;OS version, release etc)
                              lscpu= displays information aboutcpu architecture
                              lsusb= list usb devices
                              lsb_release= print distribution-specific information
                              file=determine file type



3)navigating the file system
                                a) /- The Root;entire file system hierarchy is under root;root is the outer layer.
                                 
                                  how to differentiate files and folders from appearance and without the appearance?(color; ls -l)
                                  starting with '-' =file
                                  "      "      'd' =directory


                                   linux do not emphasize on extensions as many other os do.



                                 b)bin - the files in bin folder holds machine code of command line commands

                                 c)BOOT-the files in BOOt contains kernel
                                 
                                 d)dev-contains special or device files-(to access periferal devices)
                                           c--character special file
                                           b--block special file.
