                user name
                root= super user

            e.2)host file
                file which matches ip adderess to corresponding hosts name

            e.3)configuration files
                text files that influence machine
          
          
          f)home directory
            also called login directory
            serves as the repository for a user's personal files, directories and programs

          g)lib directory
            contains shared object files (.so)...(libraries)
            object file contains machine codes.
                                        header file in a pgm contains fn declarations but no function defn. fn defn's are in libraries.
                                        if libc.so is deleted, entire system crashes(read about dynamic linking)
                                        
          h) proc directory
             contains a directory for each running process.
             files co
           i) usr directory
               it contains all the user binaries, their documentation, libraries, header files, etc....
               j.1)include contains header files
               j.2)src(source): it is not installed when installing linux as it eats up so much memory. con be downloaded when needed.
