- len(a)-returns length of a.
-a[::-1]-returns a new reversed list. (even if lists are mutable, here we have a new list created)



-a.sort()--------------> mutated list
-print sorted(a)-------> returns a new sorted list without changing 'a'
	

List Comprehension eg : [x*x for x in a]
	complex comprehension, nested comprehension
python programming approach:
in case of repetition follow
	1.list comprehension, if not possible...
	2.for, if not possible with for....
	3.while 

-unpacking:
	a,b = (1,2)
	a--->1
	b--->2

zip function

dictionary: associative array : map : mesh
- keys usually does not have any ordering( ordering keys are also available)



-none---->null

key diff between list and tuples: lists are mutable, tuples are immutables; 

-keys in dictionaryy are immutable.
-key error :when the key given is not there in the data structre'

-set default(,)
-print a.has_key('x')


dictionary comprehension:
